PyCardano
=====================================

PyCardano is a standalone Cardano client written in Python. The library is able to create and sign transactions
without depending on third-party Cardano serialization tools, such as cardano-cli and cardano-serialization-lib,
making it a light-weight library that is easy and fast to set up in all kinds of environments.
